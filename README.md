# üí´ Hi, I'm Abhishek

Computer Engineering graduate focused on Python, SQL, and practical analytics. I like turning raw CSVs into clean insights, building small automation scripts, and documenting simple, reproducible workflows. Recently exploring LLM agents, vector search, and retrieval pipelines. Open to collaborate on data-heavy projects and internal tools.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

- CRM Pipeline Analytics \& Forecasting Engine
    - Python tool that ingests CRM CSVs, computes weekly KPIs (new leads, MQL, SQL, wins), conversion rates, channel/region breakdowns, and a 4-week moving-average forecast. Exports CSVs and report-ready charts.
- LangChain Tools \& Agentic RAG Pipeline
    - Built a tool-using agent with Wikipedia, arXiv, and a custom FAISS retriever over LangSmith docs. Implemented document loading, chunking, embeddings, and retrieval to answer domain questions.
