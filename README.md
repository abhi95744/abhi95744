# 💫 Hi, I'm Abhishek

Computer Engineering graduate focused on Python, SQL, and practical analytics. I like turning raw CSVs into clean insights, building small automation scripts, and documenting simple, reproducible workflows. Recently exploring LLM agents, vector search, and retrieval pipelines. Open to collaborate on data-heavy projects and internal tools.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- CRM Pipeline Analytics \& Forecasting Engine
    - Python tool that ingests CRM CSVs, computes weekly KPIs (new leads, MQL, SQL, wins), conversion rates, channel/region breakdowns, and a 4-week moving-average forecast. Exports CSVs and report-ready charts.
- LangChain Tools \& Agentic RAG Pipeline
    - Built a tool-using agent with Wikipedia, arXiv, and a custom FAISS retriever over LangSmith docs. Implemented document loading, chunking, embeddings, and retrieval to answer domain questions.
- Crypto-Currency Closing Price Prediction
    - Time-series modeling for BTC/ETH/LTC with GRU, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM in TensorFlow/Keras. Compared models using RMSE/MAPE and visual error analysis; GRU performed best on holdout.
- Home Inventory Manager (Java)
    - Desktop app applying OOP concepts for CRUD, search/filter, image attachments, and file-based persistence; simple reporting and collections usage.
